			<h2>About</h2>
   
<p>Hi! I am Nihal Singh. I am a third year undergraduate student at the Civil Engineering department in IIT-Bombay.</p>

<p>I love gaming. From FPSs to RPGs, I play all sort of games. I am a huge fan of the Call Of Duty and Assassins Creed series. I love football. Even though itâ€™s been a while since I stopped following the premier league, I play whenever I get the chance. I listen to Metal and Rock music.</p>

<p>Coding is my favourite hobby, and a majority of my time is spent indulging in it. I have enjoyed programming ever since I knew what it meant. I continue to learn and develop new things everyday. I have fun contributing to open source as well.</p>

<p>Over the period of my stay at IIT, I have learnt a lot. I have successfully 'completed' and contributed to a few <a href="/projects">projects</a>.</p>

<p>I am currently a manager of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wncc.iitb/">The Web and Coding Club - IIT Bombay</a>.</p>
