Hi! I am Nihal Singh. I am a first year undergraduate student of the Civil Engineering department at IIT-Bombay.

I love gaming. From FPS to RPGs, I play all sort of games. I am a huge fan of the Call Of Duty and Assassins Creed series. I love football. Even though it's been a while since I stopped following the premier league, I play whenever I get the chance. I listen to Metal and Rock music.

Coding is my favourite hobby, and a majority of my time is spent indulging in it. I have enjoyed programming ever since I knew what it meant. I continue to learn and develop new things everyday.

Over the period of my stay at IIT, I have learnt a lot. I have successfully completed and contributed to a few [projects][projects].

I am currently a convenor of [The Web and Coding Club - IIT Bombay][WnCC].
