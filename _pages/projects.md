Projects are good things. Perhaps the best of things and no good project ever gets completed.
Here is the list of projects I own or have contributed to:

### Hobby Projects

* [MooDLD][MooDLD]: The ultimate Moodle Downloader. A pythonic application that automates the download of course material from [moodle.iitb.ac.in](moodle.iitb.ac.in). It has a Tkinter based GUI and uses Mechanize for scraping. Made independently for Windows, it consists of a setup which installs MooDLD with all dependencies. Developed further as an android app that lets you download all the courses with the click of a button. [***UPDATE***: **Was officially launched by the UG Academics Council at IIT Bombay in Aug '16**. However, project is ***temporarily unavailable*** due to server side incapabilities from ASC-IITB. This will shift to the Open Source section soon after the restrictions are lifted.]

* [EVENTual][EVENTual]: No more painstakingly filling or remembering event details. Save events to your default calendar with one tap. Fill out the details and get a sharable link and QR code. Use the [android app][EVENTualApp] to directly add that.

* [J.A.R.V.I.S.][J.A.R.V.I.S.]: An attempt to make a very simple, Personal Assistant that understands speech as well as text input and is capable of performing tasks other than conversing. This project is based on AIML 1.0 and uses pyaiml for using the AIML interpreter in python. AIML, is based on pattern matching and this project does not implement any sort of machine learning or language processing.

* [IITB login extension for Chrome][IITB-login-extension-Chrome]: This extension automatically logs in to [internet.iitb.ac.in](internet.iitb.ac.in) page whenever Chrome browser is opened. Added integration for [moodle](moodle.iitb.ac.in) and [gpo](gpo.iitb.ac.in).

### Hackathons

* [Run][Run]: The Run app was born at the Yahoo! hackathon and ended up winning the “most creative and fun hack” award. It is basically a multiplayer(currently only 1v1) photo treasure hunt game.

* [LendIt][LendIt]: An online sharing platform that connects lenders to borrowers. Sign in with facebook, find people near you (integrated Bing maps), request for any item. Generate and deliver the OTP to complete the transaction. Hosted temporarily online [here](http://pacific-dawn-55810.herokuapp.com/). Third prize winner in Microsoft code.fun.do November '16.

* [RPG][RPG]: An real time RPG game in which players assume roles of characters lost on a island. Players are each given a backstory and an objective. Players can interact and communicate with each other using video chat. The story progresses and you have to convince the other player to join your objective and let you live. Made using Kandy API. Third prize winner in Kandy Hackathon 2016.

* [AssistANT][AssistANT]: Help the ant find sugar for its family. A simple game inspired from the classic Bulldozer. Created using Unity 2D. Second prize winner for Lenovo GameJam '15.

* [alCHEMy][alCHEMy]: A game which completes chemical reactions, much like the classical Alchemy. Microsoft code.fun.do submission in January '16.

### Open Source

* [WnCC Website][WnCC]: The official Web and Coding Club, IIT Bombay website. Created, managed and maintained by me. The entire website is static and runs on Jekyll. Mainly serves as a portal for the Seasons Of Code (SOC) program. If you want to mentor a SOC project or have any ideas to make it look better, send a PR [here][WnCCRepo].

* [Terasology][Terasology]: Terasology is an open source renedition of Minecraft and is a platform to develop gameplay settings in the voxel world. I've been contributing to this project since October '16. The community is very active and enthusiastic, and I've had a great time with them.

### Others

* SAFE Quiz App: The SAFE Quiz App is an app developed by the Computer Science Department of IIT Bombay, to bridge the gap between technology and education. The idea is to use smartphones to conduct online examinations. I worked on this as a part of my R & D Project in Fall '16.
