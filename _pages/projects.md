Here is the list of projects I have contributed to:

* [MooDLD][MooDLD]: The Ultimate Moodle Downloader. A pythonic application that automates the download of course material from [moodle.iitb.ac.in](moodle.iitb.ac.in). It has a Tkinter based GUI and uses Mechanize for scraping. Made independently for Windows, it consists of a setup which installs MooDLD with all dependencies.

* [IITB login extension for Chrome][IITB-login-extension-Chrome]: This extension automatically logs in to [internet.iitb.ac.in](internet.iitb.ac.in) page whenever Chrome browser is opened. Added integration for [moodle](moodle.iitb.ac.in) and [gpo](gpo.iitb.ac.in).

* [AssistANT][AssistANT]: A simple game created using Unity 2D. Second prize winner for Lenovo GameJam 2015.

* [alCHEMy][alCHEMy]: A game which completes chemical reactions, much like the classical Alchemy. code.fun.do submission 2016.

* [RPG][RPG]: An RPG game in which players can interact with each other using video chat. Made using Kandy API. Third prize winner in Kandy Hackathon 2016
