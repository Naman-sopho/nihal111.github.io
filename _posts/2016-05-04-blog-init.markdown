Hi, there! You've stumbled upon my first blog post.

It's been a while since I first thought of creating my github homepage and blog. And I can't believe I finally made it.

Also, this is the first time I've used Jekyll to create a website. Apart from a few impediments in CSS, the journey to completion smooth. The markdown to HTML conversion is awesome and blog maintenance is easy as well.

I've made a projects section which I'll keep updating with my latest developments and contributions. I plan to use this blog to write about my experiences and other interesting stuff I come across.

It's been a long night. I should go to bed before sunrise!

{% highlight python %}
blog init
echo "Hello World!"
{% endhighlight %}
